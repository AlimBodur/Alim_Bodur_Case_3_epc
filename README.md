## This is a Workers Assignments Randomly C projects.

In this project I tried to assign workers randomly to companies each turn. 

There is A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J companies,

For the random assignment created a function named workers_randomize. After the randomize process, arrays (named by companies A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J) setted and printed to screen.

Set array function name array_set. This function sets arrays.

After the set process I delete to Workers array's first element and add last element.

The other set function is seniorWorkers_assignment function. This function adds to arrays last index senior workers randomly.

When the whole process done, using print_workers_array function printing to screen companies name and assigned workers.
